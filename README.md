- **20+ million EDGAR filings** and **100+ million exhibits** — from investor presentations, credit agreements, M&A, government contracts, and executive employment agreements to board composition and subsidiaries
- **800,000+ entities, survivorship-bias free** — covers every SEC-regulated filer that ever reported, including delisted companies, dissolved funds, terminated advisors, and entities no longer reporting. From insiders and public/private companies to ETFs, mutual funds, hedge funds, foreign private issuers, BDCs, REITs, shell companies, and more
- **All 500+ EDGAR form types** — annual and quarterly reports (10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, 40-F), proxy statements (DEF 14A) and voting records, registration statements and prospectuses, and everything in between, including form types no longer in use
- **Full historical time range** — from 1993 to present, with data updated in real-time

The full API documentation is available at [sec-api.io/docs](https://sec-api.io/docs).

## SEC EDGAR Filings Query API

The Query API allows you to search and filter all 20 million filings and exhibits published on SEC EDGAR using a large set of search parameters. The database behind the Query API includes all EDGAR filing form types published since 1993 and over 800,000 EDGAR filer entities, with new filings being indexed and searchable as soon as they are published on SEC EDGAR.

You can search filings by ticker, CIK, form type, filing date, SIC code, period of report, series and class IDs, items of 8-K and other filings, and many more. The API returns all filing metadata in a [standardized JSON format](https://sec-api.io/docs/query-api#response-format).

Examples are provided below, in the [official documentation](https://sec-api.io/docs/query-api), and in our [sandbox](https://sec-api.io/sandbox).

### Examples

The following example retrieves all 10-Q filings filed by TSLA in 2025.

```python
from sec_api import QueryApi

queryApi = QueryApi(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

query = {
  "query": "ticker:TSLA AND filedAt:[2025-01-01 TO 2025-12-31] AND formType:\"10-Q\"",
  "from": "0",
  "size": "10",
  "sort": [{ "filedAt": { "order": "desc" } }]
}

filings = queryApi.get_filings(query)

print(filings)
```

## Full-Text Search API

Full-text search allows you to search the full text of all EDGAR filings submitted since 2001. The full text of a filing includes all data in the filing itself as well as all attachments (such as exhibits) to the filing.

The example below returns all 8-K and 10-Q filings and their exhibits, filed between 01-01-2021 and 14-06-2021, that include the exact phrase "LPCN 1154".

```python
from sec_api import FullTextSearchApi

fullTextSearchApi = FullTextSearchApi(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

query = {
  "query": '"LPCN 1154"',
  "formTypes": ['8-K', '10-Q'],
  "startDate": '2021-01-01',
  "endDate": '2021-06-14',
}

filings = fullTextSearchApi.get_filings(query)

print(filings)
```

## Filing & Exhibit Download API

Download any SEC EDGAR filing, exhibit and attached file in its original format (HTML, XML, JPEG, Excel, text, PDF, etc.). The API supports downloading all EDGAR form types, including 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, 13-F, S-1, 424B4, and many others published since 1993 and provides access to over 18 million filings and over 100 million exhibits and filing attachments. Download up to 40 files per second.

```python
from sec_api import DownloadApi

downloadApi = DownloadApi(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# example URLs: SEC filings, exhibits, images, Excel sheets, PDFs
url_8k_html       = "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000014/nvda-20230222.htm"

## PDF Generator API

SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, and others, are typically published in HTML, XML, or text formats. The PDF Generator API enables the conversion of any SEC filing or exhibit into a PDF file, preserving all original formatting, tables, images, and other elements from the filing.

```python
from sec_api import PdfGeneratorApi

pdfGeneratorApi = PdfGeneratorApi("YOUR_API_KEY")

# examples: 10-K filing, Form 8-K exhibit
url_10k_filing = "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019320000096/aapl-20200926.htm"
url_8k_exhibit_url = "https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1320695/000132069520000148/ths12-31x201910krecast.htm"

# get PDFs
pdf_10k_filing = pdfGeneratorApi.get_pdf(url_10k_filing)
pdf_8k_exhibit = pdfGeneratorApi.get_pdf(url_8k_exhibit_url)

# save PDFs to disk
with open("pdf_10k_filing.pdf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(pdf_10k_filing)
with open("pdf_8k_exhibit.pdf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(pdf_8k_exhibit)
```

> See the documentation for more details: https://sec-api.io/docs/sec-filings-render-api

## SEC EDGAR Filings Real-Time Stream API

The Stream API provides a live stream (aka feed) of newly published filings on SEC EDGAR via WebSockets. A new filing is sent to your connected client as soon as it is published.

---

Install the `websockets` client:

```bash
pip install websockets
```

Run the example script below. Get your free API key on [sec-api.io](https://sec-api.io) and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with it.

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import json

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" # Replace this with your actual API key
SERVER_URL = "wss://stream.sec-api.io"
WS_ENDPOINT = SERVER_URL + "?apiKey=" + API_KEY

async def websocket_client():
    try:
        async with websockets.connect(WS_ENDPOINT) as websocket:
            print("✅ Connected to:", SERVER_URL)

            while True:
                message = await websocket.recv()
                filings = json.loads(message)
                for f in filings:
                    print(f["accessionNo"], f["formType"], f["filedAt"], f["cik"])

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


asyncio.run(websocket_client())
```

> See the documentation for more details: https://sec-api.io/docs/stream-api

## XBRL-To-JSON Converter API

Parse and standardize any XBRL and convert it to JSON or pandas dataframes. Extract financial statements and metadata from 10-K, 10-Q and any other SEC filing supporting XBRL.

The entire US GAAP taxonomy is fully supported. All XBRL items are fully converted into JSON, including `us-gaap`, `dei` and custom items. XBRL facts are automatically mapped to their respective context including period instants and date ranges.

All financial statements are accessible and standardized:

- StatementsOfIncome
- StatementsOfIncomeParenthetical
- StatementsOfComprehensiveIncome
- StatementsOfComprehensiveIncomeParenthetical
- BalanceSheets
- BalanceSheetsParenthetical
- StatementsOfCashFlows
- StatementsOfCashFlowsParenthetical
- StatementsOfShareholdersEquity
- StatementsOfShareholdersEquityParenthetical

Variants such as `ConsolidatedStatementsofOperations` or `ConsolidatedStatementsOfLossIncome` are automatically standardized to their root name, e.g. `StatementsOfIncome`.

### Income Statement - Example Item

```json
{
  "StatementsOfIncome": {
    "RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax": [
      {
        "decimals": "-6",
        "unitRef": "usd",
        "period": {
          "startDate": "2019-09-29",
          "endDate": "2020-09-26"
        },
        "value": "274515000000"
      },
      {
        "decimals": "-6",
        "unitRef": "usd",
        "period": {
          "startDate": "2018-09-30",
          "endDate": "2019-09-28"
        },
        "value": "260174000000"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Usage

There are 3 ways to convert XBRL to JSON:

## CUSIP/CIK/Ticker Mapping API

Resolve a CUSIP, CIK, ticker symbol or company name to a set of standardized company details. Listing companies by exchange, sector and industry is also supported.

Map any of the following parameters to company details:

- CUSIP
- CIK
- Ticker
- Company name
- Exchange
- Sector
- Industry

The function returns an array of all matching companies in JSON format. For example, a look up of the ticker `IBM` returns multiple matches including `IBMD` and `IBME`.

A company object includes the following properties:

- `ticker` (string) - the ticker symbol of the company.
- `cik` (string) - the CIK of the company. Trailing zeros are removed.
- `cusip` (string) - one or multiple CUSIPs linked to the company. Multiple CUSIPs are delimited by space, e.g. "054748108 92931L302 92931L401"
- `exchange` (string) - the main exchange the company is listed on, e.g. NASDAQ
- `isDelisted` (boolean) - true if the company is no longer listed, false otherwise.
- `category` (string) - the security category, e.g. "Domestic Common Stock"
- `sector` (string) - the sector of the company, e.g. "Consumer Cyclical"
- `industry` (string) - the industry of the company, e.g. "Auto Manufacturers"
- `sic` (string) - four-digit SIC code, e.g. "3711"
- `sicSector` (string) - SIC sector name of the company, e.g. "Manufacturing"

## Proxy Support

In certain cases, your corporate IT infrastructure may encounter issues with HTTPS requests, leading to SSL certificate errors. To resolve this, HTTP and HTTPS proxies can be passed into all API wrappers as shown in the example below. If you're unsure about which proxies to use, please consult your company's IT administrator.

```python
from sec_api import QueryApi, DownloadApi, ...

proxies = {
  "http": "http://your-proxy.com",
  "https": "https://your-proxy.com",
}

queryApi = QueryApi(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", proxies=proxies)
downloadApi = DownloadApi(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", proxies=proxies)
```
